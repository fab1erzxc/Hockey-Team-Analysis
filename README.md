# Hockey-Team-Analysis

In this project, I go through a full cycle of data analyst tasks. First, I collect data on hockey teams and their games for 21 years from a third-party site using such library libraries as requests, BeautifulSoup4 and Pandas, and then I analyze and visualize the data using such libraries as pandas, numpy and matplotlib. I consider this project to be successful, it achieves its goals, that is, to collect and analyze data.
